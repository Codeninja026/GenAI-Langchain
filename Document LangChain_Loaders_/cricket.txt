Cricket is a popular bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of eleven players each.

The game is usually played on an oval-shaped ground with a pitch in the center.

One team bats to score runs, while the other bowls and fields to restrict runs and dismiss batters.

The main formats of cricket are Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20).

A run is scored when batters successfully run between the wickets or hit boundaries.

Bowlers can dismiss batters in several ways, such as bowled, caught, LBW, or run out.

Cricket originated in England and is now loved worldwide, especially in countries like India, Australia, and England.

The International Cricket Council (ICC) governs the rules and organizes global tournaments.

The ICC Cricket World Cup and the T20 World Cup are among the most famous tournaments.

Cricket is known for its sportsmanship, team spirit, and the excitement it brings to millions of fans.
